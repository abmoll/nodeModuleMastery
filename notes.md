On November 7, 1861, legislation was passed making way for the state
university to be located in Boulder, and on September 20, 1875, the first
cornerstone was laid for the first building (Old Main Building) on the
CU campus.
The university officially opened on September 5, 1877.
Boulder adopted an anti-saloon ordinance in 1907.[16] Statewide
prohibition started in Colorado in 1916[17] and ended with the repeal
of national prohibition in 1933.
